            that keep people from enjoying their favorite activitiesâ€”whether physical or digitalâ€”by making it incredibly easy to find 
            teammates, partners, and communities who share your interests.

          <div className="about__story">
            <p>
              Picture this: Two college friends, Arnav and Rudra, sitting in their room after yet another 
              failed attempt to find people to play basketball with. The campus courts were empty, the gym felt 
              intimidating alone, and their usual workout buddies were either busy or had graduated.
            </p>
            <p>
              "There has to be a better way," Arnav said, scrolling through generic social media posts. 
              "Why isn't there a place where we can just say 'Hey, I want to play basketball at 3 PM' and 
              actually find people who are down?"
            </p>
            <p>
              That lightbulb moment led to countless late-night coding sessions, way too much coffee, and 
              eventually... Sports Social! We built the platform we wished existed â€“ a place where 
              <strong> "Want to work out at this time and this place?" </strong> gets answered with a very simple but strong: <strong>"Yes!"</strong>

            <p>
              Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ We're Arnav and Rudra, the two slightly obsessed college students who built this thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We know what it's like to want to stay active but struggle with motivation, schedules, or just 
              not knowing where to start. We've been the awkward person showing up to a pickup game alone, 
              the one who bought a gym membership and used it twice, and definitely the ones who said 
              "we should work out together" but never actually made it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sports Social isn't just our project â€“ it's our solution to a problem we lived every day. 
              We wanted to create something that would have helped us (and hopefully helps you!) turn 
              <strong> "I should exercise more" </strong> into <strong>"I can't wait for tomorrow's game!"</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Every feature we build, every bug we fix, and every late-night coding session is driven by 
              one simple goal: making it easier for people to stay active together. Because honestly? 
              Everything's more fun with friends.
